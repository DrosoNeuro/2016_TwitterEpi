ILI surveillance data from the counties and/or regions of the state of Oregon
flu.oregon@state.or.us

Dear Mrs. Crawford,

I am a researcher in the Digital Epidemiology Laboratory of the EPFL, in Lausanne, Switzerland. I am currently working on a project in which we try to use geo-tagged Twitter data from the US to make predictions about the occurence of ILI in the respective areas of the tweeters. Currently, we are using ILI surveillance data on the national and the state level in order to assess the performance of our algorithms.

However, we would also like to see whether our predictions hold in smaller geographical areas such as counties or state regions. Hence, I wanted to know whether there is any possibility to access the weekly ILI surveillance data for the counties or at least the regions of the state of Oregon (preferably in the time window from 2010 to 2015, since our model was built on Twitter data from that time). On the website of the Oregon Health Department, I could unfortunately only access the weekly summaries in pdf format, which makes usage very arduous.

Access to these data would very much help us to further test and hopefully improve our flu detection algorithm.

Thank you very much in advance for your help and best regards

Answer:
It sounds like what you'd want is our ILINet data--I could provide it in an excel file for that time frame. There would be one line per participating county per MMWR week, with the number of ILI cases and total number of patients seen for our participating clinics in those counties. The caveat is that we are pediatrician heavy in our surveillance system--it is voluntary, and for whatever reason Pediatricians seem more eager to participate. There are definitely significant bias issues with it based on who volunteers to participate in any given year.

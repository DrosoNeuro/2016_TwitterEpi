\chapter{ Keyword Recommendations}
\label{appendix:keyword_recommendations}
While our system should be trusted more than one based simply off of aggregated tweets, it is more computationally intensive than simply pulling data from a keyword stream. These systems require the user to select a specific set of keywords before data collection can begin. Keywords representing symptoms such as ``flu'', ``cough'', ``sore throat'', and ``headache'' are often chosen. We suggest  the thirty keywords  with the highest positive predictive value (see table \ref{tab:thirty_best}) be chosen as the parameters for a keyword stream. In addition to keywords related to symptoms (e.g. ``flu'' or ``sick'')  we also find keywords related to treatments (e.g. ``health,'' ``prayer'' or ``recovery'') and keywords related to negative mood (e.g. vulgarities) to be more commonly tweeted when a user is ill.
